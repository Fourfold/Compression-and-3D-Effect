# Compression-and-3D-Effect
The aim of this four-part project is to design and implement different systems that can transform an input image or audio into different outputs with unique effects. In the first part, we develop an algorithm to compress using a signal processing technique called Fast Fourier Transform. This means that the output image would have a lower resolution than the original, and a simple blurring effect is added to enhance the result. In the second part, we apply a 3D effect with multiple layers to an image where the viewer can visualize it using a pair of 3D glasses, then we apply a continuous 3D effect to landscape images for the illusion of viewing the landscape in real life. In the third part, we apply a 3D audio effect (special type of audio panning) to a music file. In the fourth part, we combine the 3D audio effect with the 3D image effect in a video where the video frames depend on the intensity of the audio. Each of these effects is theorized and implemented using MATLAB software.
